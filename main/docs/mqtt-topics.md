# MQTT topic catalog — VanMoof S5/A5 (i.MX8 `main` domain)

Every i.MX8 service talks over a **local MQTT bus** (a `mosquitto` broker on
`localhost`, started by `mosquitto.service`; all the C++ services and the Go
`gateway` connect to it). The bus is the bike's internal message fabric: each
service publishes its state/telemetry and subscribes to the inputs it needs.
The Go **`gateway`** is the only bridge off-bike — it mirrors a curated slice of
the bus to/from **AWS IoT** (Device Shadow + Jobs + telemetry).

> Scope: this catalogs the **MQTT** topics. Inter-ECU traffic over **CAN** (the
> CANopen Object Dictionary) is a separate fabric — see
> [`can-bus.md`](can-bus.md). Several services expose CAN/OD signals *onto* MQTT
> (e.g. `power` re-publishes the Panasonic pack); those appear here as the MQTT
> topic, with a note.

Ground-truthed from the service binaries in Ghidra (`/S5-v1.5/OS/*`, string +
publish/subscribe xref analysis) and the per-service decode docs. Entries marked
**(inferred)** or `?` are not fully confirmed at the instruction level.

---

## How the bus is used

- **Broker:** `mosquitto` on `localhost:1883`, **bound to `lo`** (loopback only —
  the bus is never exposed off-device). The shared `common::IMQTTClient` wrapper
  hardcodes the connect to `localhost:1883` keepalive 60 s (`0x75b`/`0x3c`) with a
  per-service client-id. Full broker + ACL settings: see **MQTT settings &
  endpoints** at the end of this doc.
- **Framework:** every C++ service is built on the same `common` layer
  (`IMQTTClient`, `StateClient`, `Timer`, `Clock`). A publish call is
  `publish(topic, payload, qos, retain)`; a subscribe registers a topic +
  callback. Payloads are usually a **single scalar formatted as text**
  (an int/float/bool) or a small **JSON** object (nlohmann-json); a few are raw
  bytes (SMP/FTP transfers).
- **Retain convention:** *state* and *version/identity* topics are published
  **retained** (so a late subscriber — including the `gateway` mirror — sees the
  current value); *telemetry/event* topics are non-retained.
- **Direction** below is from the named service's point of view: `pub` =
  it publishes, `sub` = it subscribes, `both` = both.

### Quick how-to (on the bike, over the local broker)

```sh
# watch everything
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t '#' -v

# watch one namespace
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'power/#' -v
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'ux/lock/#' -v

# read a retained value (state / version)
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'power/state' -v          # retained: current state
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'tracking/state' -v       # retained: OFF/AUTO/THEFT

# drive an actuator (publish a command)
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t 'ux/lock/unlock'   -m 'true'
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t 'power/state/set'  -m '1'
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t 'eshifter/gear/set' -m 't'
```

### Shared namespaces (who owns what)

- **`device/<name>/…`** — sub-ECU identity/health. **`monitor`** is the authority
  (publishes `device/<name>/version/{firmware,bootloader,vendor}` and
  `device/<name>/status`); **`update`** *subscribes* to these to decide what to
  flash; **`ride`** publishes the `device/motor_control/*` subset and **`power`**
  the `device/charger/*` subset. `<name>` ∈ the manifest device set
  (`motor_control`, `motor`, `charger`, `ble`, `modem`/`modem_nordic_stack`,
  battery suppliers, …).
- **`ux/*`** — owned by `ux`; consumed by `gateway` (mirror), `tracking`
  (`ux/alarm/state`), and others.
- **`power/*`** — owned by `power`; consumed by `ride` (SOC gate, mostly via CAN),
  `ux`, `gateway`, `update`.
- **`modem/*`, `ble/*`** — produced by the SPI bridges (`spi-mqtt-bridge ble` /
  ` modem`) and consumed by `gateway`/`tracking`/`update`/`ux`.
- **`$aws/…`** — AWS-reserved, only the `gateway` speaks these (to the cloud).

## gateway

Local-bus ↔ **AWS IoT** bridge (Go). It subscribes broadly to the local bus and
forwards a curated set to the cloud, and applies cloud Shadow/Jobs back down.

## update

Peripheral + system OTA. **Subscribes** to the `device/<name>/*` versions
`monitor` publishes (to decide what to flash) and drives SMP/FTP transfers for

## Not on this bus

`mqtt-ftp-service` rides the `ftp_server/command`+`ftp_server/reply` channel
(rooted at `/tmp`) for log/cert/config push-pull. `logging` pulls `error`/log
topics into `/var/log`. The CAN bridges (`spi-can-if-linux`, `imx8_bridge`) and
the SPI bridges (`spi-mqtt-bridge ble`/`modem`) translate non-IP links onto the
bus — the `ble/*` and `modem/*` namespaces above originate there.

# MQTT settings & endpoints

## Local broker (`/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`)

```
listener 1883
bind_interface lo
acl_file /etc/mosquitto/acl
persistence true
persistence_location /run/media/mmcblk2p6/config/mosquitto/
```

- **Endpoint:** `tcp://localhost:1883`, **bound to `lo` only** — the bus is not
  reachable off-device. No TLS listener, no `password_file`: the broker allows
  anonymous connects and authorises purely by the **ACL keyed on the client's
  username**. Each service connects with a fixed username (`ux-service`,
  `power-service`, `gateway`, …); phone/app sessions are authenticated at the
  **BLE/TLS layer** (the per-role client certificate) and proxied onto the bus
  under a `ble-role-N` username, which the ACL then constrains.
- **Persistence:** retained messages + the in-flight DB live on the ext4 config
  partition (`mmcblk2p6/config/mosquitto/`), so retained state (current
  `power/state`, versions, `settings/*`, `tracking/state`, …) survives reboots.
- `pkg vmxs5-embedded-mosquitto-conf` ships both files.

## Roles & permissions (`/etc/mosquitto/acl`)

### Internal service accounts — full bus (`readwrite #`)
`power-service`, `ride-service`, `ux-service`, `update-service`,
`monitor-service`, `logging-service`, `tracking-service`, `mqtt-ftp-server`,
`factory`. (`update-service` is also the username used by the `update` daemon
**and** the `lightweight_update` CLI.)

### Bridge accounts (scoped)
| User | Grants |
| --- | --- |
| `ble-ctrl` | `rw ble/#`, `rw device/ble/#`, `w logging/event/ble`, `r power/#`, `r info/#`, `r modem/info/datetime`, `r modem/system/time` |
| `modem-ctrl` | `rw modem/#`, `rw device/modem/#`, `r power/#`, `r ble/vars/update` |
| `gateway` | `r #` (mirror everything to cloud) **plus** a fixed **write whitelist** (the only down-commands the cloud may inject): `power/state/set`, `settings/{region,mode,assist_level,shift_levels,light_mode,light_auto_threshold,ride_animation_right,brake_lights,turning_lights,animation_theme,bell_sound}/set`, `ux/sound/play`, `ux/usb/settings/enable/set`, `eshifter/gear/set`, `update/start` |

### BLE phone/app roles (per-certificate; the on-bike permission model)
| Role | Name | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ble-role-7` | **Owner** | `rw settings/#`, `rw update/#`, lock control (`w ux/lock/unlock`, `w ux/lock/touch_unlock_activate`, `r …/touch_unlock_request`, `r …/info/state`, `r …/locking_while_riding`), `r ride/#`, `r power/battery/primary/info/{soc,soc_app}`, `r power/state`, `w ftp_server/command` `r ftp_server/reply`, `r ble/proxy` `w ble/proxy/config`, `r ble/findmy/{report,certified}`, `r ble/system/version_info`, `r ux/info/#` `r ux/sensor/#`, `r error/#`, `r eshifter/gear` `w eshifter/gear/set`, `r device/+/status` |
| `ble-role-11` | **Shared bike** | like Owner but `settings` is **per-key** only: `rw settings/{assist_level,shift_levels,light_mode,light_auto_threshold,bell_sound,brake_lights,turning_lights,ride_animation_right}/#` (no blanket `settings/#`), `rw update/#`, same lock/ride/power/ftp/ble subset |
| `ble-role-17` | **Bike doctor** | `rw #` (full) |
| `ble-role-22` | **Bike Hunter** | `rw #` (full) |
| `ble-role-55` | **QA Engineer** | `rw #` (full) |
| `ble-role-66` | **R&D Engineer** | `rw #` (full) |

> Convention: a setting/command is **written** to `<topic>/set`; the owning
> service validates it, applies it, and re-publishes the **current value
> (retained)** to the base `<topic>`. The cloud (`gateway`) and the app
> (BLE roles) only ever write the `…/set` form.

## The `settings/*` namespace (user/app preferences)

Writable via `settings/<key>/set`; current value retained at `settings/<key>`.
Owners read the `/set` topic and apply. Keys seen in the ACL + binaries:

| Setting key | Owner | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings/region` | ride | region → legal assist-curve cap |
| `settings/mode` | ride/ux | ride/assist mode |

| `settings/backup_unlock_code` | ux | the 3-symbol `BackupUnlock` kick-code |
| `ux/usb/settings/enable` | ux | enable the USB (phone-charging) port |

## Cloud endpoint — AWS IoT (via `gateway`)

The Go `gateway` is the only bridge off-bike. It connects to **AWS IoT Core**
over **TLS (mTLS)** — device X.509 cert + root-CA **pinning to the two Amazon
roots (CA1 + CA3)**, no `InsecureSkipVerify` (see `gateway-aws-iot`). The ATS
endpoint hostname is **provisioned per-device** (cert/config, not hardcoded in
the binary). Topic roots it speaks: `$aws/things/<thing>/shadow/*`,
`$aws/things/<thing>/jobs/*`, `$aws/rules/telemetry/+` (CBOR) — detailed in the
**gateway** section above.

## `settings/bell_sound/set` — what it does

It selects the bike's **bell (electronic horn) sound**. The bike has a
configurable bell with several built-in clips — `bell_dingdong`,
`bell_partyhorn`, `bell_ping`, `bell_submarine`, plus `bell_custom` (a
user-uploaded sound) — all string ids found in the **`ux`** binary alongside
`bell_sound` and `ux/sound/play`. Flow:

1. A writer publishes the chosen id to **`settings/bell_sound/set`**. Per the
   ACL the writers are the **`gateway`** (cloud/app → has an explicit
   `w settings/bell_sound/set` grant) and the **Shared-bike / Owner BLE roles**
   (`ble-role-11` `rw settings/bell_sound/#`, `ble-role-7` `rw settings/#`) —
   i.e. the phone app over BLE.
2. **`ux`** (the sound/UX owner) consumes it, stores the selection, and
   re-publishes the current value (retained) to `settings/bell_sound`.
3. When the rider rings the bell, `ux` plays the selected clip via
   **`ux/sound/play`**.

So it's the app/cloud setting for *which tone the bike's bell rings* — purely a
UX preference, not a security or motor control path.
